I changes something in this profile card to give it a better view. The changes are mentioned below:-

1. First I changes the profile image from avatar to a real person image. so that it's look like little realistic.

2. I use card header and footer to set the header or footer of the card. Because it is a professional card so that i try to give it a professional look.

3. Remove unnecessary icons like profile icon etc.

4. Changes color, font, adding box-shadow and some animations in the card's hover to give a better UI.

5. Remove unnecessary social links like instagram. Because it is a profile card so social links should be professional like github, linkedin, facebook, twitter etc.

6. Didn't add any paragraph to explain. Try to give the card a simple but attractive professional look.

7. Just add necessary information like contact no, email and location. Remove company name as it was in the demo card. Try to give information in short to avoid indistinctness.

8. Add some box-shadow to enhance the profile image. 

9. Changes the body color but not card. so that it will look little better and distinct.

10. And also work on responsiveness properly. The card is fully responsive in any devices like mobile, dekstop, ipad, tab etc.

11. Make the card center align so that it looks better and clear.

12. All the changes are doing with React Js and use bootstrap 5 for the card structure.
